## Notes
06/08
Finished basic frontend after two tries lol. Will now add a backend and potentially add radiuses to show the extent of the fires. Might have to switch the API for more information. Goal is to add a new backend using Java Springboot and more customizations in terms of filtering other natural disasters.
